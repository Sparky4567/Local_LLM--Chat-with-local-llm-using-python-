## My personal philosophy is simple - if it works on my machine, it should work on yours, too.

Follow instructions to configure appropriate version for your operating system and use a command below to run the example. (uv needs to be installed just once)

```
uv run main.py
```

Use (just an example) to pull your desired model.

```
ollama pull tinyllama:latest
```

Change DEFAULT_MODEL variable value in config/settings.py file.
